# Extension Icons

This folder should contain the following icon files:
- icon16.png (16x16 pixels)
- icon48.png (48x48 pixels)
- icon128.png (128x128 pixels)

## Creating Icons

You can create icons using any image editing software. The icons should:
- Be PNG format
- Have transparent backgrounds
- Represent translation or language (e.g., globe with letters, speech bubble with multiple languages)

## Quick Icon Generation

You can use online tools like:
- [Favicon Generator](https://favicon.io/)
- [Icon Generator](https://www.iconsgenerator.com/)
- Or create custom icons in Figma, Photoshop, etc.

## Placeholder

For development, you can use simple colored squares as placeholders.
The extension will work without proper icons, but they won't look professional.
